# CNS
This is the source code for the very popular Discord bot "CNS" made for THE FINALS.

## What is included
All the basic features of CNS are included. However everything to do with the website and user data has been removed.

## How do I use this
Install all the packages, change the info in `config.json` and off you go!

## Why are you releasing this
I have waited a while before releasing this to ensure that all bridges are burnt with the game. I do not think I am coming back.

## Using the name and branding "CNS"
You may use the name CNS, but this may not be connected to me (iTz_Nao) and my work. You must ensure that users are notified that this is not the original CNS Discord Bot, and that you have used material from me (iTz_Nao). Note: This is stated in the License.

## Support
If you require any support please head over to https://discord.gg/tfVNmaDtWk.

## License
You must read the `LICENSE` file, ensure that you follow it, and must somewhere on the Discord bot mention the fact that the bot is using the material and link back to the GitHub. This is already done for you in the form of a command. Ensure you follow this. Note: This is stated in the License.
